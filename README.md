### Tech

* [React] - declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces;
* [SCSS] -  preprocessor which lets you use features that aren't a part of the wider CSS standard;
* [Firebase] - Google's mobile application development platform;

> In the previous versions of the app, [Axios] was used to get Json file.
> Firebase is used for storing and getting data as a back-end part in the latest version.
